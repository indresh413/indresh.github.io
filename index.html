                <span class="text-small">Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.</span>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big" >Why We Should Learn Coding ?</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There’s no denying that technology now dominates a huge amount of       different industries. Being computer illiterate just won’t cut it any more in the world of work. And        ‘learning to code’ seems to be the buzzword at the moment. And everyone from Bill Gates to Obama is encouraging young people to give it a go.
            Coding is an essential skill in the future because it is an important part of the digital transformation. The number of jobs that require coding skills will grow exponentially because most services and products are being digitized.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Cody Swann, CEO of software development company Gunner Technology, believes teaching kids and adults how to code is one of the best ways to teach logic and persistence, two skills he says are being lost in today’s connected society.

                “Our connected society tries to push the notion that feelings are paramount, and everyone’s opinion should be respected,” says Swann. “Combine that with the powerful Internet-created echo chambers, and we have an environment where beliefs aren’t challenged anymore regardless of how nonsensical they may be.”
                
                “The lack of persistence is easier to explain. It’s the entitlement culture. Persistence means you have to keep trying and power through failure. But many people these days do just about anything to avoid failure – even if it means not trying in the first place.”</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big" >Coding is Creativity.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Coding is always considered as all about something computational, mathematical, frustrating, and boring but there is a creative side of coding as well. When programmers see something is imperfect in this world then it becomes their job to analyze the problem and to give a visionary solution. They see a complete picture of a problem people encounter and they use their creative logical approach to find out the solution for that. Just like painters, a clever programmer picks a suitable programming language, design patterns, and patterns of logical expression to implement the solution. </p>
